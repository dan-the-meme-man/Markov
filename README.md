# Markov
`markov.py` employs a Markovian trigram model of natural language. Through Discord's API, markov.py can access chat messages, read them, and develop frequency counts of sequences of words of length three or fewer. It can then generate random messages of custom length based on these frequency counts, which will approximate the writing and style of the server's users.  This project is open-source, and just for fun. I built it to replace a beloved bot that my friends and I added to our Discord server. That bot has since shut down, and mine probably isn't as good, but I think it still functions pretty well!  I hope to maintain this project and update it regularly, probably with added features and optimizations. Enjoy!
